What is Customer Churn?
Customer churn is defined as when customers or subscribers discontinue doing business with a firm or service.

Customers in the telecom industry can choose from a variety of service providers and actively switch from one to the next. The telecommunications business has an annual churn rate of 15-25 percent in this highly competitive market.

Individualized customer retention is tough because most firms have a large number of customers and can't afford to devote much time to each of them. The costs would be too great, outweighing the additional revenue. However, if a corporation could forecast which customers are likely to leave ahead of time, it could focus customer retention efforts only on these "high risk" clients. The ultimate goal is to expand its coverage area and retrieve more customers loyalty. The core to succeed in this market lies in the customer itself.

Customer churn is a critical metric because it is much less expensive to retain existing customers than it is to acquire new customers.

To detect early signs of potential churn, one must first develop a holistic view of the customers and their interactions across numerous channels.As a result, by addressing churn, these businesses may not only preserve their market position, but also grow and thrive. More customers they have in their network, the lower the cost of initiation and the larger the profit. As a result, the company's key focus for success is reducing client attrition and implementing effective retention strategy.

# **Recommendations**

**1. Targeted retention strategies for two segments:** Databel needs to implement segmented retention strategies based on customer tenure. They should focus mainly on newer customers and constantly offer them promotions and discounts for their international and unlimited data plans, to persuade them to stay with Databel. For long-term customers, it’s also important that Databel has exclusive loyalty rewards and personalized promotions to ensure they keep using Databel’s services.

**2. Marketing campaign for new users:** Databel should target new users in their marketing campaigns, emphasizing the promotions and special plans they have, like service groups, the unlimited plan, and the international plan, which offers the most value for users. They should also draw attention to yearly contracts, that offer special low prices and discounts.

**3. Optimize contract prices:** Databel should review and optimize pricing structure for different types of contracts, considering the prices of competitors. They should consider a more competitive price for monthly contracts to retain new customers while ensuring that longer-term contracts offer compelling value.

**4. Adjust data plans and fees:** Databel should implement more flexible data plans that align with customer data consumption patterns, so they are aligned with varying levels of data usage and with competitors’ pricing structures. They should reassess the prices of the regular plans, as well as the unlimited data plan, and the extra data charges fees.

**5. Address customer service experience:** Databel should invest in process improvements and comprehensive training and incentives for customer service representatives, overall and with special emphasis in California, so customer support becomes much more efficient and satisfies Databel’s customers.
