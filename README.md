# **Recommendations**

**1. Targeted retention strategies for two segments:** Databel needs to implement segmented retention strategies based on customer tenure. They should focus mainly on newer customers and constantly offer them promotions and discounts for their international and unlimited data plans, to persuade them to stay with Databel. For long-term customers, it’s also important that Databel has exclusive loyalty rewards and personalized promotions to ensure they keep using Databel’s services.

**2. Marketing campaign for new users:** Databel should target new users in their marketing campaigns, emphasizing the promotions and special plans they have, like service groups, the unlimited plan, and the international plan, which offers the most value for users. They should also draw attention to yearly contracts, that offer special low prices and discounts.

**3. Optimize contract prices:** Databel should review and optimize pricing structure for different types of contracts, considering the prices of competitors. They should consider a more competitive price for monthly contracts to retain new customers while ensuring that longer-term contracts offer compelling value.

**4. Adjust data plans and fees:** Databel should implement more flexible data plans that align with customer data consumption patterns, so they are aligned with varying levels of data usage and with competitors’ pricing structures. They should reassess the prices of the regular plans, as well as the unlimited data plan, and the extra data charges fees.

**5. Address customer service experience:** Databel should invest in process improvements and comprehensive training and incentives for customer service representatives, overall and with special emphasis in California, so customer support becomes much more efficient and satisfies Databel’s customers.
